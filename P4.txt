      <h2>4.0 SCENARIO TASKS (INDEX CARDS)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Task 1: Place your face within the face recognition circle displayed on the screen and choose your username.</li>
        <li>Task 2: Add a new food item to storage by either scanning the food barcode or entering the details manually.</li>
        <li>Task 3: Point your back camera at the barcode so it can be captured and automatically update the expiry date into the system.</li>
        <li>Task 4: Enter the food name, select the appropriate food category, and pick the expiry date using the digital calendar on the screen.</li>
        <li>Task 5: Monitor the inventory to check the food status—whether it is nearly expired or already expired.</li>
        <li>Task 6: Choose an expiry reminder action where you can decide to consume, discard, or snooze the selected item.</li>
        <li>Task 7: Based on the available items in inventory, suggested recipes will be displayed. Choose one of the suggested recipes to be directed to the recipe page.</li>
        <li>Task 8: Select any item you identify as out of stock so it will be automatically added to your grocery list.</li>
        <li>Task 9: Tap on another user’s activity log to view the activity of other users from the same family account.</li>
