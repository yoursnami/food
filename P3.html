      <h2>1.0 METAPHOR</h2>
      <p>In developing the interaction metaphors for the Smart Storage system interface, a structured user-centered design approach was adopted. The process began with identifying and analyzing the core user tasks based on previously defined personas and user goals. These tasks included adding food items to storage, categorizing them, setting expiry reminders, and accessing shared inventory data. The selected metaphors were integrated based on their clarity, relevance, and familiarity to users.</p>

      <h3>1.1 Camera Icon ‚Äì Scan Barcode</h3>
      <p>The camera icon is used to represent the ‚ÄúScan Barcode‚Äù function in the Smart Storage interface. Users frequently use their smartphone cameras to scan barcodes and QR codes as part of everyday tasks like checking product details or making payments. Thus this metaphor offers a straightforward and familiar representation of the scanning process. By leveraging this familiar visual, users can quickly understand that tapping the camera icon will activate the barcode scanner by opening their camera. This reduces the need for textual instructions and ensures smooth interaction, especially for tech-savvy users who expect intuitive functionality.</p>

      <h3>1.2 Category Icons ‚Äì Food Classification</h3>
      <p>Each food category such as Dairy, Vegetables, Snacks is represented by its own distinct icon such as a glass of milk, a broccoli and a cookie. These icons act as grouping metaphors by helping users quickly identify and navigate through food types. By using representative imagery, users can understand the content of each section at a glance without needing to read.</p>

      <h3>1.3 Emoji Alerts ‚Äì Expiry Warnings</h3>
      <p>Expressive emojis are used as visual alert metaphors to draw attention to products that are about to expire. This metaphor introduces an emotional layer to the feedback system where users immediately sense urgency or concern when seeing the alert. Moreover, the facial expression evokes an intuitive response which helps users emotionally connect with the urgency of food nearing expiry.</p>

      <h3>1.4 Plus Icon (+) ‚Äì Add New Item</h3>
      <p>The plus icon (+) is a universal symbol for adding new content and is employed here to represent the ‚ÄúAdd New Item‚Äù function. This metaphor is widely recognized across digital platforms around the world which makes it highly intuitive for users. Its simplicity allows it to fit seamlessly into the interface without requiring explanation.</p>

      <h3>1.5 Trash Bin Icon ‚Äì Discard or Remove Item</h3>
      <p>The trash bin icon is used to represent the function of discarding or removing expired or unwanted items from the smart storage system. Inspired by the common digital action of deleting files or emails, this metaphor makes it intuitive for users to understand that selecting the trash icon will remove the selected item from the inventory. It enhances the familiarity of the interface and simplifies the food management process, especially for users accustomed to digital systems.</p>

      <h3>1.6 Box Icon ‚Äì Storage Mode View</h3>
      <p>To distinguish between different storage areas such as the fridge, freezer, and pantry, a fridge icon is used as a metaphor for navigating between modes. This familiar representation bridges the gap between the physical world and the digital system, allowing users to mentally map their real-life storage organization to the smart interface. It enhances spatial recognition and supports more efficient categorization of stored food.</p>

      <h3>1.7 Shopping Cart Icon ‚Äì Recipe Suggestions & Add to Grocery List</h3>
      <p>The shopping cart icon is employed to symbolize the action of adding items to the grocery list, particularly when items run out or expire. Commonly used in e-commerce platforms, this metaphor is universally recognized and helps users understand that they are preparing for restocking. By clicking the cart icon, users can conveniently send items to their digital shopping list, making meal planning and shopping more efficient.</p>

      <h3>1.8 House Icon ‚Äì Family Dashboard or Shared Access</h3>
      <p>The house icon functions as a metaphor for a shared family environment within the smart storage interface. By tapping this icon, users can access a dashboard that shows activity from other household members, such as items added or removed, and grocery list changes. This metaphor supports collaborative usage in family homes and allows everyone to stay informed about the household‚Äôs food inventory.</p>
