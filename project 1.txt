    <h2>P1 ‚Äì PROJECT PROPOSAL</h2>
    <p>Project Title: Smart Food Storage Box</p>
  </section>

    <h2>1.0 Problem</h2>
    <p>In modern Malaysia, managing food storage and keeping track of expiration dates are significant challenges, especially among students and individuals living alone. Many individuals struggle to keep track of food expiration, often resulting in the unintentional consumption of spoiled items, posing health risks. This is particularly concerning, for those at risk like young children and senior citizens, who might not show symptoms of spoiling because of age-related drops in taste and smell sensitivity. Moreover, leftovers frequently go unnoticed in refrigerators which contributes to excessive food waste and reducing space for fresh groceries.</p>
    <p>A study conducted among Malaysian teenagers revealed that while 90.5% of participants expressed concern about product expiration dates and often read this information, a significant portion still struggled with interpreting other nutritional information due to tight schedules and confusing labels. This suggests that practical obstacles limit effective food management, despite having awareness. Furthermore, research indicates that 32.15% of Malaysians discard food because it exceeds the expiry date, and 30.32% due to spoilage. These statistics suggest the need for innovation of food storage as a solution and better education on interpreting food labels to reduce unnecessary waste.‚Äã</p>
    <p>In addition to the health and safety risks, the issue of leftover and expired food also contributes to the money waste problem. When food is not consumed on time, whether due to poor tracking of expiration dates, over-purchasing, or simply being forgotten in the refrigerator it often ends up being thrown in rubbish. This habit leads to a direct waste of money, as individuals are essentially throwing away food they paid for but never used. Over time, these small losses accumulate and can place a financial burden, especially on students and low-income households.</p>
    <p>These waste patterns and unsafe consumption behaviors show the urgent need for an innovative and user-friendly system to manage food storage and track expiration dates to promote safe food consumption.</p>

    <h2>3.0 Proposed Solution</h2>
    <p>The proposed solution involves a smart display system that can be paired with a smartphone application which offers both visual and remote notifications to users' smartphones. One of the interesting features, this system has emotionally-driven faces to signal the food status and supports the accessibility of diverse user groups.</p>

    <h3>3.1 Visual Status Indicators</h3>
    <p>This smart display system device has visual status indicators that will display the status of food items with simple and understandable face icons on the screen. When it displays a happy face, it means that the food is still fresh and safe to eat. A neutral face signals nearing expiry. A sad face indicates expired food that should be discarded. These visual cues help users (especially children, elderly, and non-native speakers) recognize food status instantly.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Notifications via Connected Smartphones</h3>
    <p>The smartphone app sends pop-up reminders to alert users at various stages: before, during, and after expiry. Alerts are customizable‚Äîusers can set notification frequency, advance warnings, and tone. This helps manage inventory proactively.</p>

    <h3>3.3 Automated Expiration Tracking Through Scanning Technology</h3>
    <p>Users can scan barcodes or QR codes when placing food in the device. The system retrieves expiry dates or estimates shelf life automatically‚Äîeliminating the need for manual input and ensuring accurate, up-to-date tracking.</p>

    <h3>3.4 Compact and Organized Storage Design</h3>
    <p>The storage box fits inside a refrigerator, grouping priority items in one container. This prevents forgotten food, frees up space for fresh items, and promotes better organization.</p>
