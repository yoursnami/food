  <h2>1.0 Gathering Requirements: User Analysis</h2>
  <pre>
User 1: University students 
User 2: Elderly individuals living alone 
User 3: Housewives with family responsibilities

1.1 PROPOSED TASK

User 1:
With limited space and a tight schedule that often leads to irregular eating times, keeping 
track of your food supply becomes increasingly challenging, especially when storage 
areas are shared and only moderate technological proficiency is available.
Tasks:
i. Scanning and adding new food item to smart storage.
ii. Receive notification for expiring food and decide action.
iii. Reorganizing food and updating the inventory before grocery shopping.

User 2: 
Elderly people living alone often struggle with memory loss, poor eyesight, and using digital devices. This makes it hard for them to manage food properly. They may forget to eat leftovers or not notice when food has expired, which can affect their health. A smart food storage system can guide them clearly using voice and colors, so they know what to eat and when. This support helps them care for themselves better, make their own decisions, and live more independently every day.
Tasks:
i. Automatic reminder to use leftover food first.
ii. Getting reminders about food that will expire soon.
iii. Emoji or colour display to show food conditions.

User 3:
Housewives have to juggle multiple responsibilities; Cooking, managing the family groceries, handling children. All the while trying to reduce food waste, staying on budget and having to plan meals in advance. They often end up purchasing food and groceries in bulk but end up struggling to track all the expiry dates or forgotten leftovers, leading to unplanned wastage.
Tasks:
i. Organizing and storing through new groceries into categories for easy access.
ii. Notifications that track expired or soon-to-be expired but unused food.
iii. Planning and searching for recipes based on current groceries.

  <h2>2.0 Gathering Requirements: Task Analysis</h2>
  <pre>
2.1 INTRODUCTION
Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) is performed to study how user needs align with specific tasks, in order to develop a product that complements both user expectations and functional requirements. The requirements from all three users, university students, older individuals living alone, and housewives with family responsibilities are analysed further for better implementation of tasks in real-life situations, thereby enhancing the overall user experience. To establish the final design, these HTAs are reviewed and compared across all three user groups before determining which tasks should be prioritised, retained, and considered most functional in achieving the goal of a smart food storage system.

  <h2>3.0 Discussion</h2>
  <pre>
3.1 TASK 1

i.  Scanning and adding new food items to smart storage.

This task involves the users initiating a process to register new food items in the smart storage box system. Based on the HTA that has been done, the user either scans a barcode of the food items or manually inputs the food details in the system. Then, the system will store information about the food items such as the item names and its expiry date. 

By using the thinking aloud techniques during the task it reveals whether the users might find scanning process perceptive or frustrating and if manually input the details feels tedious or confusing. Other than that, it is questionable how well the users understand the system feedback like either its successful scan or entry confirmation. 

ii. Automatic Reminder to Use Leftover Food First.

This task engages with the system in prompting the users to consume the leftover food before having the new items in the smart storage box. The HTA outlines how the users are notified through voices or notifications, identify the leftovers, and act upon the reminder.

By using the thinking aloud technique, it allows the expert to assess whether the reminder is understood by the users, whether users feel motivated or confused from it, and whether the users can easily follow the steps to approach or consume the food.

iii. Organising and storing through new groceries into categories for easy access.

This task involves the user scanning or entering new groceries into the system and assigning them to appropriate categories for better organization and future retrieval. The HTA includes opening the app, scanning or manually adding items, assigning categories and saving it into the inventory. 

The thinking aloud techniques helps determine whether the users understand the need for categorization of the items or if the category suggestions match their expectations. In addition, it also helps determine how intuitive the category selection interface is, especially under time pressure. This method exposes potential breakdowns, such as uncertainty about category names or hesitations during item entry.

3.2 TASK 2

i. Receive notification for expiring food and decide action.

This task involves the system alerting the users when food is close to its expiry date, prompting them to take an appropriate action which either consume, discard, or add it to a shopping list. The HTA that was included in the system are receiving the notification, checking item details, evaluating the expiry condition, deciding on a course of action and updating the system inventory. 

With thinking aloud, it can be observed that whether the sers notice and understand the urgency of the notification or if the system’s interface supports or delays their response. This process helps identify barriers in comprehension, timing, and motivation.

ii. Getting reminders about food that will expire soon.

This task involves the system proactively reminding the users that a food item in the storage box will expire soon. The HTA breakdown includes the system checks expiration dates and triggers a reminder to the users. The reminder is delivered as a notification by voices and visuals. Then, the user will check the item and decide on what to do with it. 

Using the thinking aloud techniques here helps to identify whether users feel the reminder is helpful, overwhelming, or easy to ignore. It also helps identify how users interpret the urgency from the reminder. It is crucial to test how well the reminder translates into action, especially for users with memory, visual, or attention limitations.

iii. Notifications that track expired or soon-to-be expired but unused food.

This task involves the system monitoring all items in the smart food storage box and notifying the users when the food is about to expire or already expired but unused. The HTA involves a background tracking of expiry dates, notification trigger for near-expiry or expired items, user receives and reads the alert given and decides to take the action, and system will update the inventory status.

Using the thinking aloud techniques during this task highlights whether they use the prompt as a call to action or if the users trust the system’s reminders and find them helpful or disturbing. It also highlights whether the users understand the distinction between ‘about to expire’ and ‘already expired’. 

3.3 TASK 3

i. Reorganize food and update inventory before grocery shopping.

This task focuses on users preparing for grocery shopping by physically checking current food stock, reorganizing items, removing expired food, updating the inventory in the system, and generating a shopping list. These features might be useful for the users in terms of budgeting and efficient shopping experiences. 

With thinking aloud techniques, evaluators can observe whether the users remember to check the inventory before shopping. It can also observe if the users trust the system’s inventory status or prefer to double-check manually. For some users, a basic inventory system can help to reduce any food waste especially if they may forget or skip any steps.
ii. Emoji or colour display to show food conditions.

This task uses visual indicators like emojis and colors to show the condition of food stored in the smart system. A green / happy face indicates the food is safe to eat, a yellow / neutral face indicates an nearing expiry food condition and a red / sad face indicates the food is already expired. The HTA includes the system that checks the food condition based on expiry date, assigns visual status, displays status on screen, and users interpret the visuals shown to take an action. 

Through thinking aloud techniques, it can be observed if users understand the color or emoji scheme easily. It also can be observed how much users rely on these indicators versus reading dates manually or if any of the visual cues cause confusion, especially among colorblind or elderly users.

iii. Planning and searching for recipes based on current groceries.

This task allows users to view their current inventory, search for or receive suggested recipes based on what is available, add meals to a plan or begin cooking immediately, and update the inventory once the ingredients are used. The HTA steps include opening the smart food storage app, navigating to the ‘recipe suggestions’ section, browsing for recipes based on available ingredients, selecting a recipe, cooking the recipe, and marking used items to update inventory.

The thinking aloud techniques reveal whether users feel overwhelmed or assisted by the suggestions given or if they trust the recipe suggestions based on what’s in the fridge. It also reveals if the process from the recipe to the meal plan feels intuitive and convenient to the users.

ii. Expiry monitoring
Description: The system simultaneously tracks the expiry date of each item and notifies users using emojis, colour codes, and multimodal reminders consisting of visual and audio notifications, thus enabling the user to respond with either a discard, consume, or snooze action.
Justification: Timely reminders will alert users to manage their food and reduce waste while keeping their food consumption safe, using multimodal notifications to accommodate various users with visual and auditory impairments.


iii. Inventory management:
Description: This system allows inventory management by updating the quantity and expiry date, and viewing item conditions through color coding and emoji indicators. With both voice and touch support, recipe suggestions based on available ingredients are provided, in addition to the ability to update the grocery list.
Justification: Providing real-time monitoring will help with grocery shopping by reducing unnecessary purchases, while ensuring the system remains flexible for a wide range of users through the implementation of multiple interaction modes.

Non-functional: 
i. Accessibility
Description: The system employs large fonts, a high-contrast user interface, intuitive icons, and voice controls to support users with visual and auditory impairments.
Justification: Users with various backgrounds and impairments can benefit from the design due to its accessibility and comfortable interaction, regardless of user ability.

ii. System feedback 
Description: The system provides an immediate response to actions such as adding and editing items through voice or visual confirmation.
Justification: Prompt feedback will reassure the user that the input has been received by the system, thereby reducing repetitive actions and minimizing confusion.

iii. Reliability
Description: The system design aligns with the goal of operating continuously with minimal maintenance and trustworthy status indicators.
Justification: Systems with reliable goals build user trust by requiring less technical maintenance and ensuring consistent performance, especially when dealing with food management that may impact user safety.
iv. Integration
Description: The system integration featuring inventory tracking, expiry reminders, recipe suggestions, and grocery list generation is synchronized across devices.
Justification: Seamless integration ensures efficiency by allowing users to manage various features through a single platform, providing a comfortable experience and eliminating redundancy.

New design requirement:
Description: The system should include multi-user profile management to allow multiple users to log in to the system simultaneously on different or shared devices.
Justification: Supporting multiple user logins enhances efficiency, especially in shared households, by allowing all members to contribute to food management efforts.
