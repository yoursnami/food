    <h1>P4– Prototyping and Evaluation </h1>

    <div class="section-block">
      <h2>1.0 PROTOTYPE OVERVIEW</h2>
      <p>This project focuses on the design, development, and evaluation of a functional prototype aimed at addressing a specific user need or problem scenario. The prototype represents a preliminary implementation of the proposed system, enabling early testing of core features and user interaction design. The development phase involved translating design concepts into a tangible interface, incorporating essential functionalities that align with the identified user requirements. Special attention was given to usability, accessibility, and practicality to ensure the prototype effectively supports its intended tasks. Following the creation of the prototype, an evaluation process was conducted involving targeted user testing. The evaluation aimed to assess usability, identify potential issues, and gather feedback to guide further improvements. Observations and insights obtained through this phase are critical in validating design choices and ensuring that the system meets user expectations./p>

      <h2>      <h2>3.0 BRIEFING NOTES</h2>
</h2>
      <p>Hi! We are from PR07 and would like to welcome all users to explore our newly designed Smart Food Storage Box. It features expiry date monitoring, inventory tracking with grocery list updates, and supports multiple user logins, all tailored to meet your needs.</p>
      <!-- [Metaphor sections unchanged for brevity] -->

      <h2>Informed Consent</h2>
      <p>We are conducting a study to help us explore and improve the development of our design. Your name and personal information will be kept confidential. This paper-based survey is intended solely to capture your experience and opinions while testing the prototype of our design. Participation is completely voluntary, and you may choose to stop at any time without any obligation. As a token of appreciation for your support, a small gift is provided. Your feedback is valuable in helping us enhance the design.</p>

      <h2>Prototype Overview</h2>
      <p>An extensive user interface is built into this storage box to help with simultaneous synchronization with the system, allowing you to track it from a distance using multiple devices logged in under the same family. This tracking is designed to assist users from various backgrounds in monitoring their stored food status, which is mostly identified using the expiry date label on food packages. Apart from keeping you safe from consuming food that is no longer safe, this feature, with various functional purposes such as inventory, groceries, and recipes, helps users explore useful actions. Prioritizing user-friendliness and elderly users, some actions are equipped with voice commands and visually clear instructions to ease the learning process of the system. This prototype is made using a website, with sequential actions set for each tab and empty boxes symbolizing the food storage box. 
We are still in the process of developing the actual synchronized device and interface. Please consider the current output as a genuine reflection of the design, and feel free to point out anything that may not work as expected. Let us know if you experience any inconvenience during this testing, so we can further improve the design.

	<div class="section-block">
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>One of our team members will demonstrate the login section, where you can choose between two methods: face recognition—where you can simulate looking at a camera placed on the website, and selecting from a list of names that represent multiple user options for a family account. The system will then guide you through a series of tasks designed to reflect the actual experience as closely as possible. Please help us by sharing your feedback while testing, it will greatly support us in improving the interface. That makes you our official test user!
Feel free to help others who may use this product in the future. Don’t hesitate to share your thoughts, whether something is unclear, not functioning properly, or if you’d like to share a positive comment about the design. Your first task is ready. Are you excited to explore this new idea and help turn it into a real product? Join us in making it better, and don’t forget to collect your appreciation token before you leave!

      <h2>4.0 SCENARIO TASKS (INDEX CARDS)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Task 1: Place your face within the face recognition circle displayed on the screen and choose your username.</li>
        <li>Task 2: Add a new food item to storage by either scanning the food barcode or entering the details manually.</li>
        <li>Task 3: Point your back camera at the barcode so it can be captured and automatically update the expiry date into the system.</li>
        <li>Task 4: Enter the food name, select the appropriate food category, and pick the expiry date using the digital calendar on the screen.</li>
        <li>Task 5: Monitor the inventory to check the food status—whether it is nearly expired or already expired.</li>
        <li>Task 6: Choose an expiry reminder action where you can decide to consume, discard, or snooze the selected item.</li>
        <li>Task 7: Based on the available items in inventory, suggested recipes will be displayed. Choose one of the suggested recipes to be directed to the recipe page.</li>
        <li>Task 8: Select any item you identify as out of stock so it will be automatically added to your grocery list.</li>
        <li>Task 9: Tap on another user’s activity log to view the activity of other users from the same family account.</li>
